## Description
======
As the complementary course of MATH1851, students will be introduced to more topics of mathematics commonly applied in engineering so that students could be further enhanced with a concrete skill in mathematics underpinned for different engineering subjects. The course emphasizes mathematical concepts, principles, analysis, and their relationship to the modelling of engineering systems.  Students could be furnished with the essential mathematical skills to analytically tackle some typical engineering problems to prepare for all the engineering subjects.

## Duty
======
As a teaching assistant, I need to be responsible for answering questions about course content and solving problems encountered by students in their programming practice. I need to prepare exam papers and conduct assessments.
