### Description
This course is a undergraduate-level course that introduces the theory of data science and its application in a wide range of civil engineering (in particular transportation engineering) problems. The course will first illustrate existing examples/systems/applications of transportation big data and data science, to help students understand resources of transportation big data and some fundamental knowledge of data science. Then the course will introduce the theory, principles and methodologies of data science for engineering. In the meantime, the course will demonstrate the application of data science on solving a variety of real-world engineering problems, including spatio-temporal traffic state prediction, human mobility pattern discovery, traffic congestion identification and characterization, traffic incident analysis, operations and control of smart mobility

### Duty
As a teaching assistant, I need to be responsible for answering questions about course content and solving problems encountered by students in their programming practice. I need to prepare exam papers and conduct assessments.
